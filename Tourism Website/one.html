        <h3>Tokyo Skytree</h3>
        <p>
          The Tokyo Skytree is an observation and broadcasting tower located at 1 Chome-1-2 Oshiage, Sumida City, Tokyo.
          Standing at 634 meters and being one of the tallest towers ever built, it is an exhilarating experience to be able to see almost
          all of Tokyo from the tower above and highly recommend anyone who visits Tokyo come visit this tower.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <h3>Tsukiji Market</h3>
        <p>
          The Tsukiji Market located around the area of 4 Chrome -7-5 Tsukiji is a marketplace/bazer full of food/dining related businesses.
          In this market whether it is you want to shop for different kinds of seafood ingredients or simply get a bite to eat at one of the restaurants here,
          the Tsukiji Market is a great place to fit all sorts of food related activities.

        <p>
          The Shibuya Crossing is located in the Shibuya district in Tokyo, and is known as the wall street/times square of Tokyo/Japan.
          It is the commercial and business center of the Shibuya district of Tokyo which is also one of the busiest districts of all of Tokyo.
          One of the main interests in this is that at rush hours and rush times of the year, there can be literally thousands of people crossing,
          which in itself is enough of a sight for people to actually visit this specifically when coming to Tokyo.

          The Universal Studios of Japan is located at 2 Chome-1-33 Sakurajima, Konohana Ward, Osaka
          and is the first Universal Studios built outside of the United States. This place is a great theme park to visit as it incorporates Japanese life
          into the theme park, serving japanese snacks at the stands and many more. Overall a great theme park to visit and a fun place for people of all ages.
        </p>

        <h3>Osaka Castle Park</h3>
        <p>
          The Osaka Castle Park is located at 1 Osakajo, Chuo Ward, Osaka and is a great naturalistic place to explore in Osaka.
          In the peak cherry blossom season (early months of the year) you can see beautiful cherry blossom trees surrounding the ancient castle at the center of the park.
          Whether you enjoy it for the nature or history it is a great visit for anyone and not to expensive as compared to Universal Studios.
        </p>

          Namba is known as the “National Kitchen” of Japan as it is the main shopping and dining district of Osaka.
          Whether you are here for expensive adventures or simply getting a bite to eat, Namba offers it all for people of all ages,
          when visiting Osaka you just cannot leave without visiting the Namba district.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <h3>Kinkakuji</h3>
        <p>
          The first place we will talk about in Kyoto is Kinkakuji which is a temple/park located at, 1 Kinkakujicho,
          Kita Ward, Kyoto. The temple was originally built in 1397 as a residence for the old shogun, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu.
          Not only is it a beautiful temple to visit in Kyoto but the surrounding area of the temple
          is an amazing scenery to behold along with the whole place holding a lot of historic value in terms of Japanese history.
          This may not be a place to bring younger people (they may get bored) but regardless it is a beautiful place to visit for anyone.
        </p>

      <div class="column">
        <h3>Monkey Park Iwatayama</h3>
        <p>
          The Monkey Park: Iwatayama is located at 〒616-0004 Kyoto, Nishikyo Ward, Arashiyama Nakaoshitacho and is an absolute thrill for anyone.
          In this area you are able to go on a nice natural hike in the natural habitats of these monkeys,
          this is a complete joy especially if you are someone from a western country in which you can only see monkeys behind cages within zoos.
          Being able to experience wild monkeys like this first hand while taking a nice walk is a completely recommended experience for people of all ages.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <h3>Gion</h3>
        <p>
          Gion is the geisha district/neighborhood in the city of Kyoto and is an amazing cultural place to visit in Kyoto.
          Whether you want to sip on traditional tea or you simply want to view the beautiful architecture offered here in Gion,
          this is a peaceful and amazing place to visit. I would recommend people of more mature audiences as kids tend to not be recommended
          in areas like the Gion, but overall a great visit for anyone older visiting Kyoto/Japan.
