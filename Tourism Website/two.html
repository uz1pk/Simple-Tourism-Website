        <h3>Pocket Wifi</h3>
        <p>
          The first thing that you should purchase in advance or from Japan is some sort of portable wifi.
          Of course most tourists may opt to get a sim card or something of sort which is fine,
          as long as you have some means of connecting to the internet in the foreign country.
          When travelling you should assume no one will be willing to help/show you around or give a helping hand
          so it is important to make sure that you have some means to help yourself around certain situations.

        <h3>JR Rail Pass</h3>
        <p>
          Secondly you may need to get a JR Rail Pass for crossing long distances, when something like a bus or walking would take just too long.
          However you must make sure to do your research because depending on the length of your trip along with which cities you are planning to visit
          it may actually not be necessary to get a pass at all, so make sure to take your own look into the JR Rail Pass,
          and see whether it is something you would need for your trip.

        <h3>Japanese Travel Guide</h3>
        <p>
          A travel guide is quite self-explanatory, but many new tourists tend to look over travel guides,
          most high quality travel guides out there actually provide a lot of insight into getting around, safe places, food,
          locations, proper etiquette and more. In spite of how childish or trivial it may sound,
          keeping a travel guide with you before and during the trip will guarantee to prove useful in many circumstances.

        <h3>Plan the season you would like to visit</h3>
        <p>
          When visiting any place in Japan there are many activities and parts of each city that is almost entirely exclusive to a certain season,
          meaning you can only participate in those given activities during a certain time of the year.
          So it is important to take a look at what you will want to do when visiting Japan and plan your trip accordingly so you can get the most out of it.
          Keep in mind Japan’s tourist attractions tend to be very season based, therefore it must be kept in mind when selecting what time of year to go.

      <div class="column">
        <h3>Buy tickets for popular events in advance</h3>
        <p>
          One aspect of travel one may not take into consideration is that it's going to be busy.
          When visiting a worldwide tourist hotspot like Japan, it is crucial to take into consideration that there will be a lot of people
          going most likely at the same time you will be, so when planning which events/places you want to go it is also important to get and sort of admission
          to them in advance to prevent overflow. The last thing you want is coming to Japan excited for a certain event only for tickets to be completely sold out
          for the entire time you are there.
        </p>

      <div class="column">
        <h3>Know the rules of each place you plan to visit</h3>
        <p>
          Especially when visiting the other side of the world, it is extremely important to not only familiarize yourself with the laws,
          but also the proper cultural “rules” that you must follow. The last thing you want is talking to someone who may become a friend,
          only for you to ruin the entire mood simply because of something you didn’t know was offensive.
          Therefore it is extremely important for this reason to familiarize yourself with cultural norms.

        <h3>Know what to pack</h3>
        <p>
          Make sure you pack accordingly, again sounds self-explanatory but the amount of times people over or under pack for a trip is insane.
          When overpacking you end up having to pay more overall because the luggage inherently takes up more space,
          thus costing more when moving it around. While on the other end of the spectrum,
          when under packing you have to overspend on some unnecessary items in the other country which may end up costing more in the end.
          In the end just try to pack as accordingly as possible.

      <div class="column">
        <h3>Buy travel insurance</h3>
        <p>
          An aspect of travelling that new travellers may or may not know is something known as travel insurance.
          When visiting a foreign country risks for sickness, crimes, missing items, etc rise exponentially as most people know where the tourists tend to be.
          It is important to buy some sort of travel insurance to protect yourself from the unexpected that could occur in a foreign country.
        </p>

      <div class="column">
        <h3>Plan your path in advance</h3>
        <p>
          Plan your path in advance, what I mean by this is think of a rough idea of what days you will visit and what events/attractions
          so that your time is budgeted accordingly and you have maximized your time staying in Japan.
          The last thing you want is an underwhelming trip in which you thought you could’ve done more,
          but didn't due to poor plan/time management.
