      There are many reasons to visit Japan that suit every sort of interests anyone may have. If you are a history enthusiast,
      Japan (or Nippon) is flourishing with beauty from ancient architecture that continues to stand and provide today,

          When most people think Japan or anything related to Japan, the first city that tends to pop up to mind is Tokyo and this is with good reason.
          Tokyo is the largest city in Japan, it is known to be the New York City of Japan due to its size, business and the people.
          There are many attractions within Tokyo and the possibilities of the types of entertainment that can be found in Tokyo are endless,
          from movies, restaurants of all types, cultural events, really anything can be found here.
          At the top of this page you will find a link to attractions if you would like to see more about Tokyo.

        <h3>Osaka</h3>

        </div>
        <p>
          Osaka (and most other cities other than Tokyo) is one of those cities which make the experiences and joys in Japan more accessible to people due to it’s lowered prices in comparison to Tokyo.
          Even more than Tokyo, Osaka is known for its amazing foods/cuisine along with having a similar setting to Tokyo in that it is a large city without being as condensed as Tokyo (in spite it being the third largest city in Japan).
          The picture shown above is actually a place in Osaka known as Dotonbori which is considered to be the “Nation’s Kitchen” since it is a packed marketplace full of all of the amazing food Japan has to offer.
          Osaka is also home to the first Universal Studios theme park that was built outside of the US which is also better showcased on the Top Attractions page found at the top of this page, along with all the other great attractions Osaka has to offer.

          Out of all the popular cities in Japan that tourists visit, my personal favorite is Kyoto.
          Kyoto offers an out of world experience for anyone interested in Japanese history or architecture.
          From the amazing temples that can be visited in Kyoto, to the nature sceneries in which many deer roam a little outside the city,
          Kyoto is a great place for someone who wants the experience of going to Japan while also having a peaceful trip (contrary to what is found in Osaka and Tokyo).
          Alongside this Kyoto is known as the “Culture Central” of all the cities in Japan,
          allowing tourists to experience traditional Japanese practices alongside traditional Japanese lifestyle.
          Overall Kyoto is a great place to visit regardless of what you may enjoy and is a must visit if you are anywhere near Osaka,
          in which you can get a JR Rail Pass to get to Kyoto in just a few hours!
          The JR Rail pass and details about it can be found by clicking the link at the top which will take you to the “What is Needed?” page in which we talk about how to plan a trip to Japan.
